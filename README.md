# Sextans Suite

Sextans Suite is software to support FAIR Metadata (Sextans Sight) and FAIR Data (Sextans Fix) authoring and publishing.

Sextans Sight creates a Metadata server following the FAIR Data Point specifications, that should be deployed on a publicly-accessible server (e.g. in your Demilitarized Zone).  Sextans Fix is an optional second component that includes software for executing data transformations compatible with the Clinical and Registry Entries Semantic Model (CARE-SM).  Sextans Fix should be deployed inside of your firewall, and can only be accessed via tightly regulated calls from Sextans Sight (see detailed documentation below).
